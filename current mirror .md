**Given** :

Vdd=1.8V.

P<=1mW.

Av>-10V/V.
It=P/Vdd.
It=Iref+Ix.
## DC Analysis:
# For mirror ratio 1:1:
 It=Iref+Ix.
 for mirror ratio 1:1 ratio iref is equal to Ix.

 the given values are,
 P= 1mw.
 vdd=1.8v.
 # Dc analysis :
 ![circit 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00468e5b-aada-45b8-808b-ab1ca0bd7ff9)
 
 we know that It=P/vdd.
 It = 1mw/1.8v = 0.55mA.
 Iref is half of the It value that is 0.275 mA.
 the given W/L values to get ratio 1:1 are 2.8um/180nm.
 we need to provide vin value such a way that the circuit should be in saturation . now the provided value is 0.854v.

 ## output for L = 180nm
