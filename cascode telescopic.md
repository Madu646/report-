## Cascode Telescopic Differential Amplifier 

The Telescopic Cascode Amplifier is known for its excellent high-frequency performance, attributed to the reduced Miller effect and high output impedance achieved through cascode stacking.
This topology is often preferred in high-speed and low-noise applications, such as high-resolution analog-to-digital converters and data acquisition systems. However, 
one major limitation of the telescopic architecture is its restricted output voltage swing, which becomes more pronounced in modern low-voltage CMOS processes.To overcome this constraint, 
the Folded Cascode OTA introduces a current folding mechanism, allowing for greater voltage headroom and improved input/output swing without sacrificing gain significantly.
This makes it more suitable for low-voltage and low-power applications, such as portable electronics and biomedical devices.

## Design Description
Telescopic Cascode Differential Amplifier
The Telescopic Cascode Amplifier is designed for high gain and low noise in high-speed analog applications. The name "telescopic" refers to the vertical stacking of transistors, which gives it a compact structure but limits voltage headroom.
Circuit Components and Function:
•	M1 and M2 (Differential Pair):
o	NMOS transistors that form the input stage.
o	Convert differential input voltage into differential current.
o	Biased by a constant current source (tail current).
•	M3 and M4 (NMOS Cascode Devices):
o	Cascode transistors placed above M1 and M2.
o	Improve output impedance and isolate Miller capacitance.
o	Boost gain by increasing effective output resistance.
•	M5 and M6 (PMOS Cascode Current Mirrors):
o	Act as active loads.
o	Mirror and combine the currents from each branch.
o	Ensure symmetrical operation and help drive a single-ended output.
•	M7 (Tail Current Source):
o	Provides a stable bias current for the differential pair.
o	Typically implemented using a wide-channel NMOS transistor or current mirror.
## Key Characteristics:
•  High gain due to the cascode stacking.
•  Limited output swing, since each transistor stage consumes voltage headroom.
•  High-speed operation due to low parasitic capacitance.
