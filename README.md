# Experiment-1
# Aim:
To do the DC analysis,Transient and AC analysis of a CS amplifier circuit and 
extract the various parameters associated using LT Spice.
# Components required: 
Resistor(22k),voltage supply(1.8V,0.9V), connecting wires and N Mosfet(nmos4,pmos4 )
# Theory:
MOSFET is the most important component in the electronic devices 
mosfet act as amplifier in saturation region when vgs>vth and vgd<vth or vds>=vov
# CONFIGURATIONS:
1) common source configuration - there is 180' phase  diffrence between input and output
2) common drain configuration - there is no phase diffrence between input and output
3) common gate configuration - there is no phase diffrence between input and output

There is very high input impedence
The drain current

**Id= 1/2*kn*(Vov)^2**; **Vov=Vgs-Vth & kn=W/L*un*Cox** for lambda = 0.
